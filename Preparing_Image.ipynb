        "##During the experiment, an unavoidable presence of additional yellow lighting was introduced, which altered the true color appearance of the specimen in the captured images. This unintended lighting effect caused a color distortion that could compromise the accuracy of subsequent analysis. To accurately reveal the specimen's original color characteristics, it is essential to eliminate the influence of this yellow light. In this section, we applied a series of image processing techniques aimed at correcting the color distortion. These methods were specifically chosen to isolate and remove the yellow light component, thereby restoring the specimen’s true color profile for more reliable visual and quantitative assessments."
