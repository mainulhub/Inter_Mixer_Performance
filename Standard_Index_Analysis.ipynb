        "## In this section, a variety of quantitative indices have been utilized to evaluate how effectively the two colors—red and blue—are mixed within the image. These metrics provide different perspectives on the quality and uniformity of color blending by analyzing structural, statistical, and perceptual characteristics.\n",

        "\n",
        "##**Structural Similarity Index (SSIM):** Assesses the perceived visual similarity between the mixed color regions and a reference, taking into account luminance, contrast, and structural information.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Mutual Information Index:** When red and blue colors are blended in varying intensities across an image, the resulting image contains a mixture of pixel values that depend on the contribution of each color. Mutual Information helps assess how much knowing the intensity value of red tells us about the intensity value of blue, and vice versa.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Mean Squared Error (MSE):** Quantifies the average squared difference between corresponding pixel values, providing an indication of color distortion or loss.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC):** Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) is a statistical method used to measure the similarity between two signals or patterns. When applied to a single image where two colors (e.g., red and blue) are mixed, NCC helps evaluate how consistently or uniformly these two color components are spatially distributed and aligned.\n",
        "\n",
        "##**Standard Deviation Uniformity:** Examines the uniformity of color distribution by measuring the spread of pixel intensities, where lower variation typically indicates better mixing.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Together, these indices offer a comprehensive analysis of the color mixing process, helping to determine both the effectiveness and consistency of the blending between red and blue tones."
